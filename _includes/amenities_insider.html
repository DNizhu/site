                        <p class="para-insider">Every time you walk into an Of10 Insider location, you’ll be greeted by a friendly host and prompted to check in
                            at the kiosk up front. All you have to do is show your booking confirmation text — we’ll send you a text with the
                            WiFi password in the morning, and another one an hour before dinner service begins to give you a
                            heads up.</p>

                        <p class="para-insider">Once you’ve checked in, choose any seat you like. Grab a power cord if you need it, help yourself
                            to coffee or tea, and come and go as you please. It’s like your favorite café, but with fewer
                            distractions and (much) faster WiFi.</p>

                            All of our locations have plenty of room for you to work with other team members, and our guest
                            policy makes it easy to invite people to the “office” — their first hour is free, and after that you’ll
                            be
                            charged INR 100/hr (maxing out at the day rate of INR400). All we ask is that you respect your fellow
                            members
                            and reserve loud talking for the private meeting rooms.
