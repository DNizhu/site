We have seen too many good ideas perish simply because their creators are too scared to leave behind a traditional professional life to go against the grain and pursue them. We have personally experienced the sheer monotony of a corporate job that confines you to a box and conditions you to believe that work is simply following orders and not pushing the boundaries.

With Of10, we hope to inspire millennials like ourselves and show them that there is absolutely nothing stopping them from changing the world. We hope to give people so much more than just a co-working space; rather, a community that they can learn from, be inspired by, work hard and play harder with.

Good ideas and unconventional wisdom need to be championed; we intend to champion the people behind them.
