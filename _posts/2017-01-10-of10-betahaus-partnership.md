Of10 members now have the exclusive chance of availing five days of free coworking at any Betahaus location through Europe. So, if you want to take a vacation without actually taking a vacation, travel to any one of their beautiful locations and experience something new in the world of coworking spaces.

Who knows? You could even Revel in the Raval in Barcelona, hunt down bargains in Mauer Park of Berlin, take a boat tour to get a taste of the maritime culture in Hamburg or indulge in a food tour in Sofia in your free time. All this packed with a one-two punch of the unique coworking experience at Betahaus, youâ€™ll be able to explore the minds of people that come from a different cultural background or transform into a better version of yourself with the international exposure and formation of a new partnership that may just last a lifetime.

With this collaboration, we wish to redefine the future of work and display our support for coworking spaces across the map.
