Are you as tired of the same, old routine life as we are?
Are you looking to explore the world a little and make your deadlines at the same time irrespective of
which part of the world you’re in? Well, Of10 has recently formed a collaboration that might just be
fruitful for all of us.

“Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.”

In another bid to provide value to our members, Of10 has partnered up with Betahaus.
It is a coworking space for like-minded people who wish to nurture their creativity,
knowledge and ideas in a way that inspires
those around them and promotes growth and development.
They wish to open doors and explore new possibilities in the world of professional work.
They have office spaces in Berlin, Hamburg, Barcelona and Sofia.
They have a dream of fostering entrepreneurship, creativity, rapid prototyping and innovative product development.

Just like us, their community consists of start-ups, entrepreneurs, freelancers, creators, small scale businesses and corporate teams, etc.
They provide their members with coworking spaces, event spaces, meeting rooms,
a café, a hardware lab and a woodshop. Their services also include an academy, acceleration programs and start-up competitions.

The Of10 perks never seem to stop, do they? This time, we offer Of10 members the exclusive chance of availing
five days of free service at any one of the Betahaus locations.
So, if you want to take a vacation
without actually taking a vacation, travel to any one of their beautiful locations and experience
something new in the world of coworking spaces.

Who knows? You could even Revel in the Raval in Barcelona, hunt down bargains in Mauer Park of Berlin,
take a boat tour to get a taste of the maritime culture in Hamburg or indulge in a food tour in Sofia in your free time.
All this packed with a one-two punch of the unique coworking experience at Betahaus, you’ll be able to explore the minds of people that come from a different cultural background or transform into a better version of yourself with the
international exposure and formation of a new partnership that may just last a lifetime.

With this collaboration, we wish to redefine the future of work and display our support of coworking spaces across the map.
So, take a break from your humdrum life and spoil yourself with a mini-vacation! Betahaus will treat you well, that’s a promise from us!
