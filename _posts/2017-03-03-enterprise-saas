Over the last few years, Indian startups have copy pasted successful B2C models from the western world and attracted
lot of interest from hedge funds. Some startups packed up even before they laid their foundation while others were
juggling with their global competitors and even lobbying for protection.

Today, we are habitual to Facebook, Google, Whatsapp but, enterprises are still locked with legacy systems from
giants like SAP & Oracle. Consumerzing enterprise software is a huge opportunity globally and VC’s in India has not
been able to utilize this space efficiently.

Existing infrastructure is too old to solve the problems of tomorrow. Data silo problems are common among
enterprises and getting insights is challenging in the world of vendor lock-ins.
Consumerzing enterprise software is a clean shot in any vertical-be it payroll, accounting, supply chain or inventory
management. Most of the employees are forced to use tools with clunky & dysfunctional UIs and this is where innovation
should step in. Big bucks are spent in training employees and the cost to integrate different systems is exorbitant.
It’s high time we reinvent and replace the decades old technological infrastructure.

Companies like Docusign, Box & Slack have demonstrated that enterprises are ready to adapt modern SAAS tools.
The next wave of enterprise software companies will not just be about big data but also smart data.
Today, employees need specific insights driven by AI.

At OF10, we are resilient about solving present day problems in order to flourish future development.
